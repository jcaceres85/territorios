What is GeoNode?
----------------

GeoNode is a geospatial content management system, a platform for the
management and publication of geospatial data. It brings together mature
and stable open-source software projects under a consistent and
easy-to-use interface allowing non-specialized users to share data and
create interactive maps.

Data management tools built into GeoNode allow for integrated creation
of data, metadata, and map visualization. Each dataset in the system can
be shared publicly or restricted to allow access to only specific users.
Social features like user profiles and commenting and rating systems
allow for the development of communities around each platform to
facilitate the use, management, and quality control of the data the
GeoNode instance contains.

It is also designed to be a flexible platform that software developers
can extend, modify or integrate against to meet requirements in their
own applications.


Territorios en Riesgo
---------

This Geoportal is derived from the study Territories at Risk II, which is a
contribution to the debate on the future of the extraction of minerals,
hydrocarbons and the generation of electricity in Honduras, pointing out the
possible risks in the neighboring territories with these activities, based on
cartography to identify conflicts related to the territory.

The main objective of this Geoportal is the visualization and dissemination
of maps and geographic information related to the mining cadastre and
renewable energy; for the identification and spatial location of tax and
conflict issues in Honduras.
